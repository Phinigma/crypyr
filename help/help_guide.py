                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h3>Q: Why isn't my AES key working?</h3>
                <p>A: Ensure your key length is correct. AES requires keys of 16, 24, or 32 bytes (corresponding to 128, 192, or 256 bits).</p>
                <h3>Q: How can I retrieve a password from the vault?</h3>
                <p>A: Enter your master encryption key and click 'Load Vault' to decrypt and display your stored passwords.</p>
                <h3>Q: What should I do if I forget my encryption key?</h3>
                <p>A: Unfortunately, without your encryption key, you cannot access encrypted data. It's essential to remember or securely store your keys.</p>
                <h3>Q: Is the File Shredder effective on SSDs?</h3>
                <p>A: Due to the way SSDs manage data, secure deletion isn't guaranteed. Consider using full-disk encryption for better security on SSDs.</p>
                <h3>Q: Can I use Cypyr on multiple devices?</h3>
                <p>A: Yes, but ensure that you transfer any necessary keys or data securely between devices.</p>
                <h2>Troubleshooting Tips</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption/Decryption Issues:</strong> Double-check that you're using the correct key and algorithm.</li>
                    <li><strong>Password Vault Errors:</strong> Verify that your master key is correct and that the vault file hasn't been corrupted.</li>
                    <li><strong>Application Crashes:</strong> Ensure you have the latest version installed and that your system meets the minimum requirements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Feature Not Working:</strong> Consult the relevant section in this guide and confirm all steps were followed correctly.</li>
